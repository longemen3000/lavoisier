# Lavoisier

## What?

Lavoisier pretends to be a chemical process simulator, using numpy and the python ecosystem to provide a CAPE-OPEN-compatible system of sofware and tools.

## Why?
at this moment, there is no such thing as a chemical process simulator in python. we are here to provide that.

## How?
By leveraging the computational power of numpy. engineers around the world are familiarized with python and numpy, and we'll try to bring those tools to the world of chemical engineering.
The following components are necessary for a minimum viable product:
* Chemical component database
* Material object component: responsible for holding the chemical data of a flow.
* Thermodynamic engine:  responsible for the temperature and presure dependent properties and phase calculation. 
* Unit operation module: Operations on the material flows, like mixing, reactors, pumps, compressors, etc

## When?
I can't answer that yet.

## Who?
at the time, we are two (2) chemical engineering graduates, from the University of Concepci√≥n

## Can i join?

Of course!, we dont have nothing, but you can start by reading the cape-open implementation.
