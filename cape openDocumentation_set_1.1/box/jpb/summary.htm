        <p align="left"><font size="4">This document, which was
        produced by the Numerical work package, describes the
        Interface Specifications for the Sequential Modular
        Specific Tools (SMST) Component of the CAPE-OPEN
        Interface System.<br>
        <br>
        The document contains a text description of the
        requirements for an open SMST Component. These
        requirements are also expressed in Unified Modelling
        Language and developed into a specification of the
        interfaces necessary for a CAPE-OPEN SMST Component to
        plug into a compliant flowsheet simulator. These
        specifications are provided. A tutorial is made
        available.</font></p>
