    <p><font size="4">Hereafter, you have a quick and basic
    presentation of solvers at flowsheet level which are
    integrated in the CO Sequential Modular Specific Tools
    Component.<br>
    <br>
    Find a good introduction about these functionalities in <em>Process
    Flowsheeting - A. Westerberg, H. Hutchison, R. Motard, P.
    Winter - Cambridge University Press - 1979.</em> especially
    in the chapter 6 The Sequential Modular Approach to
    flowsheeting.<br>

    This manual concerns only Sequential Modular simulators which
    are the most commonly used for process simulation.<br>
    <br>
    In this approach, there are, at least, two levels of
    calculations :<br>
     the unit level : calculation of all the output stream
    values given values for all input streams and for all
    operating and equipment parameters<br>
     the flowsheet level : calculation of all the tear stream
    values given values for all residuals on recycle streams and
    specification equations.<br>
    Note that, at least, streams include material, information
    and energy streams.<br>
    <br>
    The CO SMST Component is only concerned by the flowsheet
    level : partitioning of the flowsheet, search of the
    calculation sequence of the units.The different tools are the
    following : <a href="#Partitioning">Partitioning</a> <a

    Sequential Modular Analysis</a><br>
    <br>
    These functionalities are called by the  Pre-Processor 
    part of a CAPE Simulator. They are integrated into the CO
    SMST Component.<br>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Partitioning a flowsheet is to locate the groups of
        units (single unit and Maximum Cyclic Networks MCN) which
        must be solved together. Each of these groups should
        contain the smallest possible number of units. There is
        one unique result for the partitioning of a given
        flowsheet.<br>
        <br>
        MCN = a cycle which is not contained into another cycle
        (usually called Partition)<br>
        A Partition can be a group of units or a single unit.<br>

    <p><a name="Tearing"><font color="#008080" size="4"><em><strong>Tearing</strong></em></font></a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Tearing is the analysis of each Partition to determine
        tear streams. For each Partition, a set of independent
        variables defining the tear streams will be used as
        iterative variables at the flowsheet level.<br>
        <br>
        There are many competing algorithms which give
        significant differences in performance. <br>
        Hereafter some <a href="bibliography.htm">bibliographic
        references</a>:<br>
         Barkley and Motard (1972)<br>
         Pho and Lapidus (1973)<br>
         Upadhye and Grens (1975)<br>

        The result and the efficiency of the tearing depend on
        the criteria chosen by developers of tearing algorithms.
        The final choice of tear streams is essential for the
        convergence capabilities.<br>
        <br>
        The criteria are the following :<br>
         the minimum number of tear streams<br>
         assign a weight to each stream. This weight can
        reflect the expected difficulty associated with tearing
        the stream and may, for example, be equal to the number
        of significant torn variable values in each stream.
        Search the tear streams which minimise the sum of the
        weights<br>
         tear to give the best convergence characteristics. For
        example, Upadhye and Grens define the decomposition of a
        flowsheet, that is the choice of tear streams, as
        belonging to two classes : redundant and non redundant.
        Non redundant decomposition have better convergence
        properties than redundant ones for the method of
        successive substitution<br>
         others<br>
        <br>
        These above criteria are just mentioned in order to
        illustrate the strategy that can be used. CAPE-OPEN
        project makes no judgement about their relative merits,
        it must only provide all the useful information to
        tearing developers through the interface definition. <br>
