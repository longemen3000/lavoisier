    <p><font size="4">Flowsheet simulators are designed to
    calculate the behaviour of processes. They take a description
    of the flowsheet topology and process requirements and
    assemble a model of the flowsheet from a library of unit
    operations contained in the simulator. For example, the
    flowsheet below represents a single stage from an oil and gas
    separation system:</font></p>

    <p><font size="4">This would be simulated in a typical
    commercial simulator from a description of the topology,
    probably entered through a GUI and looking much like the
    above picture, plus a description of the process
    requirements. It is a simple flowsheet that would use the
    flash, compressor, cooler and junction unit operations.<br>
    <br>
    Although the simulator mimics the plant behaviour, it is
    organised differently. For example, in the plant the unit
    operations are connected together directly, e.g. the cooler
    connects directly to the separator. In the simulator, the
    unit operations are not connected to each other, but only to
    the executive. Also, in this plant there are 3 distinct flash
    separators, whereas in the simulator there is only one flash
    algorithm, which is reused by the executive as required by
    the topology.I<br>
    <br>
    This is a straightforward flowsheet that could be adequately
    simulated by most simulators. However, if, for instance, the
    separations were to be done with a membrane unit, it might be
    necessary to use an external representation of the membrane
    unit to capture the specific performance of a proprietary
    membrane. Most simulators allow external unit operations to
    be added, but, because of the proprietary nature of the
    interface between the unit operations library and the
    executive and the monolithic structure of the simulator, this
    is a bespoke activity for each simulator. The result is a
    non-standard version of the simulator, which can be difficult
    and expensive to maintain. <br>

    <p align="left"><font size="4">The CAPE-OPEN (CO) project
    envisages a new situation whereby a SMST (and other simulator
    software sub-systems, such as unit operations, thermodynamic
    or numerical packages) can be bought off-the-shelf and
    plugged directly into any compliant simulator without
    modification, compiling or linking and will continue to work
    with subsequent versions of the simulator. All that is
    required is that the SMST and the simulators conform to the
    CAPE-OPEN Interface System. This System will be defined by
    the CO project, which is organised into work packages. Three
    of these work packages deal with the main sub-systems of a
    simulator that are likely to be exchanged: unit operations
    (UNIT), thermodynamics (THRM) and numerical tools (NUMR).
    This document is produced by the NUMR work package and
    describes the requirements of the part of the CAPE-OPEN
    Interface System dealing with Sequential Modular Specific
    Tools.</font></p>
