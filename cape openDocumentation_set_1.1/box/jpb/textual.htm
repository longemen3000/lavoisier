the CAPE-OPEN Process, you can find below a synthesis from the
main User Textual Requirements.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4">Within an unique CAPE-OPEN
        Sequential Modular Specific Tools (CO SMST) Component,
        the </font><a href="general.htm#Partitioning"><font

        functionality, the </font><a href="general.htm#Ordering"><font

        functionality, the </font><a href="general.htm#Tearing"><font

        and the </font><a href="general.htm#Sequencing"><font
        size="4">Sequencing</font></a><font size="4">
        functionality are integrated.<br>
        They can be accessed separately and from different parts
        of the client.<br>
        The Partitioning functionality and the Ordering
        functionality are merged into the Partitioning of the CO
        SMST Component.<br>
        Therefore, this component will provide the services for
        Partitioning solver, Tearing solver and Sequencing
        solver.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4">In order to make easier
        the access to the all functionalities, the CO SMST
        Component can provide also a Full Sequential Modular
        Analysis solver.<br>
        It makes the full Sequential Modular analysis : search of
        the calculation sequence of the partitions and units.<br>
        So, that means it calculates the Partitioning of a
        flowsheet, next the Ordering of the partitions, next the
        Tearing of the partitions and next the Sequencing of
        units of each partitions.<br>
        To propose the Full Sequential Modular Analysis solver,
        the CO SMST Component suppliers can reuse some/all
        already implemented solvers or can implement an
        independant solver. It is invisible to the client.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4">Through the CO SMST
        Component, the client can call services from each solver
        individually.<br>
        The client can use one solver or several ones.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4">The CO SMST Component
        suppliers can provide one, several or all the four
        flowsheet solvers.<br>
        The four flowsheet solvers are : Partitioning, Tearing,
        Sequencing and Full Sequential Modular Analysis.</font></p>
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font size="4">The interface will be
        designed with the aim of transferring the graph
        connectivity and weightings.<br>
        Therefore, the CO SMST Component doesn't need to have
        access to the complete unit and stream information. The
        units and streams of the flowsheet will be referenced by
        basic identifiers. So, no direct link between the CO SMST
        Component and a CO Unit (or Thermodynamic) Component is
        necessary.<br>
        The graph connectivity represents the process flowsheet.<br>
        The weightings calculated by the client contains the
        &quot;process knowledge&quot;.<br>
